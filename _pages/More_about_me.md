I was born in Fengqing, a small city in the province of Yunnan in southwest China. 

"Yun" (云) means clouds as Yunnan is situated on Yungui Plateau (云贵高原）. "Nan" (南) means south as Yunnan is in southwest of China. 

One of my childhood passions was observing and immersing myself in the sheer diversity of the biological world.  My twin sister and I loved to run around in the woods, observing all of the living things in the forest, changing, growing, and carrying out their unique life cycles.
