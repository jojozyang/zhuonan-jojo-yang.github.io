I am an aspiring Ph.D. student interested in the intersection of mind, brain and computational science. 

I am currently working on an independent computational modeling project with Professor Marcelo Mattar from NYU.

I have explored the mind/brain at multiple levels, from the level of molecules and cells, to neural systems and the complexities of behavior, to the cognitive computations of learning. With inspiration from all of these different levels, I am excited to focus on cognitive neuroscience for my Ph.D.
