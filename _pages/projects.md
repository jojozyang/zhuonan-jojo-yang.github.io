## Computational processes that contribute to complex animal behavior

{: style="text-align: justify" }
### Loren Frank Lab | UCSF | Systems/computational neuroscience 
Mentored by David Kastner, I helped to develop a novel experimental paradigm for studying individual animal variability in the learning of a spatial alternation task. A unique feature of this task was the interleaving of multiple task variants, which allowed us to explore the dynamic and continual learning process. We also sought to develop a computational model of animals’ learning, which demands a large amount of data. To achieve this, we built an automated system for collecting high-throughput behavioral data for a long period of time (> 100 days). We compared and fitted the animals’ behavior to that of the model as a way of generating and testing hypotheses for how the animals might be cognitively achieving the task.

In this accelerated video, one of the animals visited several reward wells on the automated track. When the animal finished the task, the track door automatically opened. After the animal went back to his box, next animal was allowed to come out of his box and carry out the tasks.
